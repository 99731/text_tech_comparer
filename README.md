# text_tech_comparer

This project aims to survey the text processing techniques that transform raw text to numerical information (e.g. TF-IDF, LDA, Word2vec).  Although there are many resources (blogs or reddits) on the Internet, they often focused on one technique, used a toy dataset, or showed part characters of the techniques. To provide a comprehensive review of theses techniques and their characters, this project intends to compare these techniques with different datasets and popular libiraies of open sources.
